# <center>What Does This Extension Solve?</center>

Before ChatGPT and similar tools existed, I often ran into a problem: I needed a quick way to handle large SQL `CREATE` scripts and convert them into TypeScript classes. That’s why I built **classConverter**—a simple but powerful extension that makes this process fast and easy, saving me a ton of time during development.

But I didn’t stop there. I wanted to address another common pain point I faced: integrating utility packages that I frequently use in Angular projects. So, I added built-in support for [class-transformer](https://github.com/typestack/class-transformer). This allows users to personalize their decorators to suit their specific needs, making it even more versatile.

Because we all work with different languages, I added another cool feature: effortless conversion of Java classes into TypeScript. No more tedious manual conversions—just let the extension do the heavy lifting for you. This saved me so much time back in the days!

Curious to see how it works? Head over to the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LorenzoCruccu.classConverter) for a quick tutorial—it’s simple, but it’ll get you started.

With tools like Copilot and GPT-powered assistants around now, this extension might feel a bit outdated. Even I don’t use it anymore! But back when AI-driven helpers weren’t so advanced, **classConverter** was a real lifesaver for me and my co-workers.
